    This call is intended to force the datasource to flush any pending

    a datasource should include any work that might be accomplished by
    calling SyncToDisk() on layers in that data source.

    This function sets the attribute query string to be used when fetching

    The query string should be in the format of an SQL WHERE clause. For

    Move read cursor to the nIndex'th feature in the current resultset.
    
    This method allows positioning of a layer such that the

    an absolute index into the current result set. So, setting it to 3

    Only in rare circumstances is SetNextByIndex() efficiently

    To determine if fast seeking is available on the current layer use the

    Set a new spatial filter.
    
    This function set the geometry to be used as a spatial filter when
    fetching features via the OGR_L_GetNextFeature() function. Only
    features that geometrically intersect the filter geometry will be

    be returned. This can result in more shapes being returned that should
    strictly be the case.
    
    This function makes an internal copy of the passed geometry. The
    passed geometry remains the responsibility of the caller, and may be
    safely destroyed.
    
    For the time being the passed filter geometry should be in the same
